                The day is drawing to a close and the sun is setting, painting the sky a beautiful pink.
                That's when you find a mysterious, glowing seashell. 
                What do you do?

            <p>
                Well, whatever you chose... you failed and ended up inside the wave.
                But you find it odd. You didn't feel any pain?
            </p>
